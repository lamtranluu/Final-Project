- Requirements :
- Web Scraping
- NLTK,sklearn, CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer,word_tokenize
- NRC Lexical, VADER...
 
## ‚öôÔ∏è Method :
1. Write a Web Scraping fucntion in Python to gather 20,000 reviews from 20 movies in IMDB website.
2. Implement Data Cleaning process to clean data:
- remove special characters & repeated sentences which are in the bottom of each reviews

4. Sentiment Analysicc with Classified Modeling:
- Select another movie dataset (50,000 rows) from Kaggle with human labled.
- Apply 2 different feature selection to compare the accurracy: BOW & TFIDF
- Train Logistic Regression Model with 90% accuracy
- Aplly a better model on a data set from Marvel & DC.

6.Lastly, in order to understand which topic are releated to user review, i designed some list of words, use BOW feature to find downd the number of words in each reviews.
- For example, from word cloud Marvel, we obtained the point that audience love the action sequence from Marvel series, there for i create a list which indicated about the curiosity , such as: 'post credit','easter egg','curious','eager','wait' to know in which topic Marvel recieved more psotive feedbacks.
